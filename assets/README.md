# Assets Directory

This directory contains images and figures used in the README and documentation.

## Required Files

Add the following files to make the README complete:

- `overview.png` - Overview figure of the Stethoscope for Networks framework (from Figure 1 of the paper)

You can extract these from the paper figures or create your own visualizations.

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for best quality
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 1MB per image)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Maintain aspect ratios

## Creating the Overview Figure

The overview figure should illustrate:
1. The four stethoscopes: Delta, Merge, Freeze, Destruction
2. The relationship between base models and reasoning models
3. The key finding that o_proj is responsible for reasoning
